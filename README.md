## ðŸ“œIntroduction.
This project consists in analysing the Iris dataset, available in the UC Irvine machine learning repository.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris.

The Iris dataset contains, as its name suggests, Iris flowers data. 
It consists in 150 flower samples, classified into three species: **Iris-setosa**, **Iris-versicolor**, and **Iris-virginica**.

The Iris dataset has a total of five variables, which are divided into:
- A target variable, which is the one to be explained, consisting in this case of the species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

- Four independent variables, which are characteristics measured in centimeters, related to the sepals and petals of each species:

â—½ Sepal length

â—½ Sepal width

â—½ Petal length

â—½ Petal width

## ðŸ§ªAnalysis.
The aim of this project is to analyse the iris data set, performing a exploratory data analysis (EDA):
1. How the dataset is structured. 
2. Visualization of each feature, using Matplotlib.
3. Correlations between variables
4. Comparison between species
5. Visualization of the information. 
6. Conclusion. 

## Program structure
- Import lybraries needed.
- Import dataset and read the dataset.
- Rename columns for easier reading.
- Display general information of the dataset. 
    -  Dimension of the dataframe: How many columns and rows the dataset contains.
- Display the names of each species 
- Display the first five and last five rows of the dataset. 
- Get the number of  data for each species.
- Import matplotlib
- Histogram of each characteristic.

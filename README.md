## ðŸ“œIntroduction.
This project consists in analysing the Iris dataset, available in the UC Irvine machine learning repository.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris.

The Iris dataset contains, as its name suggests, Iris flowers data. 
It consists in 150 flower samples, classified into three species: **Iris-setosa**, **Iris-versicolor**, and **Iris-virginica**.

The Iris dataset has a total of five variables, which are divided into:
- A target variable, which is the one to be explained, consisting in this case of the species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

- Four independent variables, which are characteristics measured in centimeters, related to the sepals and petals of each species:

â—½ Sepal length

â—½ Sepal width

â—½ Petal length

â—½ Petal width

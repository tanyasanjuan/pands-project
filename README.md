# pands-project


## 📜 Project Introduction.
This project consists in analysing the Iris dataset, available in the UC Irvine machine learning repository.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris.
This project consists of exploring and visualizing the analysis of the Iris dataset, seeing the correlations of Iris species based on their morphological characteristics (sepal and petal). Using libraries such as Matplotlib, and using Pandas for the data processing.

## 📁 Repository Structure
This repository is organized in: 
- README.md 
- analysis.py
- iris.csv
- visualization of the data in format png.
- summary.txt 

## 🎯 Objective
- Load the iris dataset.
- Perform a exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize a histogram of each variable to png files.
- Visualize a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
- Output a summary of each variable to a single text file.
- Conclusions.


# 🌷 Iris dataset
The Iris dataset contains, as its name suggests, Iris flowers data. 
It consists in 150 flower samples, classified into three species: **Iris-setosa**, **Iris-versicolor**, and **Iris-virginica**.

The Iris dataset has a total of five variables, which are divided into:
- A target variable, which is the one to be explained, consisting in this case of the species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

- Four independent variables, which are characteristics measured in centimeters, related to the sepals and petals of each species:

◽ Sepal length

◽ Sepal width

◽ Petal length

◽ Petal width


## 💻 Program structure
- Import lybraries needed.
- Import dataset and read the dataset.
- Rename columns for easier reading.
- Display general information of the dataset. 
    -  Dimension of the dataframe: How many columns and rows the dataset contains.
- Display the names of each species 
- Display the first five and last five rows of the dataset. 
- Get the number of  data for each species.
- Display the mean, std, min, max and median for each feature.
- Import matplotlib
- Histogram of each characteristic.
